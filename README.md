This repository is a collection of general and specific information on event related NLP tasks (such as: event extraction, event argument extraction, event-event relation extraction and event knowledge graphs), covering definitions, annotation guidelines, tools and resources. 

The porpuse of this reporsitory is to consolidate information on event related tasks. I hope that this repository will provide an overview of event related tasks to anyone interested in studying or expanding his knowledge on event related tasks.
