## Introduction
Events play a critical role in natural language understanding. This is not only at the core of text understanding but is also beneficial to various applications at the multi-text level.  Events are often related within a larger narrative, which involves the chaining of multiple events.

With the growing number of documents describing real-world events and event-oriented information, the need for efficient methods for accessing such information is apparent.
