# Event Related Tasks and Resources 
This repository contains general and specific information on event related NLP tasks (such as: event extraction, event-event relation identification and event knowledge graphs), covering datasets, definitions, annotation guidelines, tools and resources. 

The porpuse of this reporsitory is to consolidate information on event related tasks. 

I hope that this repository will provide an overview on those tasks to anyone interested in studying or expanding his knowledge in this subject.
