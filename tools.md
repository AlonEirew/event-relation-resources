## Apache UIMA
Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or located-at.

## Brat Rapid
Brat is a web-based tool for text annotation; that is, for adding notes to existing text documents.

Brat is designed in particular for structured annotation, where the notes are not freeform text but have a fixed form that can be automatically processed and interpreted by a computer.

## CAT
CAT, the Content Annotation Tool (formerly known as CELCT Annotation Tool), is a general-purpose web-based text annotation tool.
The aim of the tool is to make the annotation activity as intuitive as possible, supplying, at the same time, a rich set of features. The main strengths of CAT are flexibility, usability and customizability. It also supports multi-layer annotation in order to combine the annotation of several linguistic/semantic levels.

## CorefAnnotator
A  tool for the annotation of co-referring entities in texts.

## CoRefi
CoRefi is a web-based coreference annotation suite, oriented for crowdsourcing. Beyond the core coreference annotation tool, CoRefi provides guided onboarding for the task as well as a novel algorithm for a reviewing phase

## CROMER
Cromer is a tool for manual annotation of event
and entity coreference across clusters of documents. The tool has been developed to handle large collections of documents, perform collaborative annotation (several annotators can work on the same clusters), and enable the linking of the annotated data to external knowledge sources.

## Text Annotation Graphs (TAG)
TAG is a web-based software tool for annotating text (inspired by Brat). It provides functionality for representing complex relationships between words and word phrases, the ability to define and visualize relationships between the relationships themselves (semantic hypergraphs). Additionally, it includes a visualization mode in which annotation subgraphs, or semantic summaries, are used to show relationships outside of the sequential context of the text itself

## WebAnno
WebAnno is a general purpose web-based annotation tool for a wide range of linguistic annotations including various layers of morphological, syntactical, and semantic annotations.Additionaly, custom annotation layers can be defined, allowing WebAnno to be used also for non-linguistic annotation tasks.
